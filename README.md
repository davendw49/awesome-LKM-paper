## Introduction

***Big thanks to ChatGPT for helping us to draft this section. We have investigated a lot about integrating LLMs and KBs for building more powerful AI model, which Prof. Wang name it as [LKM (Large Knowledge Model)](https://www.techbeat.net/article-info?id=4608).***

A large knowledge model refers to an AI model that combines the capabilities of a large language model with access to extensive knowledge bases. These models are designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of natural language inputs by leveraging both pre-existing knowledge and contextual understanding.

By integrating a large language model with knowledge bases, an AI system can access factual information, verify statements, provide explanations, and answer complex questions more accurately. This combination allows the model to tap into a vast pool of knowledge and provide informed responses based on the context and information it has access to.
